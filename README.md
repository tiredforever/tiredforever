- 👋 Hi, I’m @tiredforever, I am here to ask the community to please help me. I am a female been targeted through cyber attacks for two years non stop.
Starting in 2020 I understood it to be a Komodo hack (a tech guy in my town confirmed the screen shots). I'm not a tech person although looking back over the last two years, I have a learnt a whole world exists out here which can be the good and real ugly.
I'm tired. My health also is getting worse mentally and physically day by day due to this invasion of privacy and having my life stolen from me. 
I've had our music website which is 10 years old hacked and content stolen. My personal life exploited everywhere and it keeps coming every day.
I'm opening my heart and asking for your help to please help me get safe and try find a way out of this portal of darkness :(
Our website was music and events and built off passion, love, friendship and love for the music.
In 2019 we found an online developer who was going to help us but for one year didn't deliver , he hold us ransom many times for money and after one year delivered nothing but took loads of money and that's kinda where this all started.
My team have started to doubt me and think I am crazy and my business partner and I didn't speak for months due to a combination of me starting to not trust anyone and then thinking I am crazy with my account of my experiences.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... good people who can help me solve this never ending horror nightmare I have become part of.
From trying to follow what is haokening I believe the developer I mentioned started this and used my data for many diff new companies he has started (from my research)
My data and rest has then been sold to create a loop of never ending havoc and distress.

I have thousands of screenshots, and lots of info, keywords, names I've seen throughout the hacks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
